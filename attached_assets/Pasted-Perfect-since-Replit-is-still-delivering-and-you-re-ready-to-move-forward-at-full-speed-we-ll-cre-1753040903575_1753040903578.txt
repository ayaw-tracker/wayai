Perfect — since Replit is still delivering and you're ready to move forward at full speed, we’ll create a Phase 2 Roadmap that activates the currently-inactive tabs, replaces the redundant AI button with a meaningful placeholder (Login/Signup), and begins preparing for multi-tab AI intelligence and user personalization.

✅ YOU ARE HERE — End of Phase 1: MVP Foundation
✅ Prop filters working with live + fallback data

✅ AI modal delivers intelligent analysis

✅ Production-grade structure: No dev toggles, clean UI

✅ Replit proven capable

🚀 Phase 2 Roadmap — "Complete the Shell, Activate the Mind"
🔹 Goal: Make every visible tab functional, replace duplicate UI, and prepare for intelligent user sessions.
🔧 Tab Activation Plan
1. Trends Tab (New Component)
Purpose: Show top daily/weekly trends across props and player behavior.

Action Items:

 Create Trends.tsx component

 Pull in real-time or fallback trend data (mock structure to start)

 Show cards for:

Most bet-on props

Props with highest hit rate last 7 days

Props with sharp/public % divergence

✅ Use the existing card layout from Main for consistency
✅ Banner: “Real-time Trends – Updated Daily”

2. History Tab (New Component)
Purpose: Display historical logs of past props and outcomes.

Action Items:

 Build History.tsx

 Mock structure:

Date

Player

Line (e.g., 5.5 rebounds)

Result (Hit or Miss)

 Add dropdown: filter by sport, team, or player

✅ Eventually supports user login history
✅ Use AYAW’s parlay structure as inspiration

3. AI Chat Tab (New Component)
Purpose: Persistent AI memory chat (sports betting assistant)

Action Items:

 Build AIChat.tsx

 Reuse sidebar chat UI but move into full tab layout

 Start with mock conversation logs

 Add “New Conversation” + “Continue from Modal” features

 Prepare for OpenAI thread integration (future)

✅ Unlike the modal, this will have multi-question context memory
✅ Later supports user AI summaries & trend briefings

4. Ask AI Header Button → 🧹 REPLACEMENT
Current issue: This is a duplicate of the prop card’s modal trigger.

Action Items:

 Remove this button from the header

 Replace with Login | Signup button

 Clicking it opens modal or routes to /login page

🔐 User Auth Placeholder (Prepare for Phase 3)
We don’t need full auth yet, but we want to visually introduce it.

📍 Login Modal / Page Placeholder
“Welcome to WAY — Get personalized prop tracking & AI summaries.”

Button: Continue with Google (disabled or mock)

Banner: “Login required to save your props and AI chats (coming soon!)”

✅ Make it feel real, even if backend isn't wired yet
✅ Ready for Firebase Auth once desired

🧭 Final Task Queue for Replit (Phase 2)
Feature	Component	Priority
✅ Remove Ask AI from header	Layout	High
🚧 Add `Login	Signup` placeholder	Layout
🔄 Activate Trends tab with mock data	Trends.tsx	High
🔄 Activate History tab with mock data	History.tsx	Medium
🧠 Build AI Chat tab (repurpose modal + expand)	AIChat.tsx	Medium
✨ Adjust tab switching UX if needed	Layout.tsx	Low

🧠 Developer Note to Replit (Optional for Copy/Paste)
“We’re ready to move to Phase 2. The goals now are to activate the existing shell tabs with real or mock data, enhance the AI UX with a full tab experience (vs modal only), and introduce login/signup visuals to prep for user accounts. Let’s treat this as the second leg of the race.”

Want me to also create a Phase 2 UI preview (wireframe or description) or the next Replit message to hand over?
