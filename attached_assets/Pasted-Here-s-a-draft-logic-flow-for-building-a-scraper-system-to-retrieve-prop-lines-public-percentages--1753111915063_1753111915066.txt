Here's a draft logic flow for building a scraper system to retrieve prop lines, public percentages, movement, and other relevant data from PrizePicks, Underdog, and mainstream sportsbooks (e.g., DraftKings, FanDuel), all while staying focused on free and legally scrappable endpoints:

🧠 Way AI: Prop Line & Sentiment Scraper Logic
✅ GOAL:
To gather real-time prop lines, public betting sentiment, and line movement across multiple platforms — enabling Way AI to make informed insights, spot line inefficiencies, and deliver actionable alerts.

🧩 SYSTEM MODULES
1. 📄 Target Sites & Data Points
Site	Target Data	Accessibility
PrizePicks	Player name, stat type, line, projection	Requires dynamic scraping (JS-heavy)
Underdog Fantasy	Same as above	Similar structure to PrizePicks
DraftKings	Prop line, movement, public % if shown	Some APIs can be hit
FanDuel	Prop line, movement, status	Heavier obfuscation
Reddit (r/sportsbook, r/dfsports)	Trending picks, crowd opinions	Free + open
X.com (Betting tipster accounts)	“Leans”/tailing % sentiment	Needs smart filtering

2. 🔧 Scraper Stack (Free + Efficient)
Node.js + Puppeteer / Playwright

For dynamic sites like PrizePicks and Underdog (scrolling, JS-rendered).

Axios / Cheerio (Fast HTTP)

For static content, API-based data (e.g., DraftKings public endpoints).

Rate Limiting & Throttling

To avoid bans. Use rotating User-Agents and proxy support.

3. ⚙️ Scraper Logic Pseudocode
ts
Copy
Edit
function scrapePrizePicks() {
  const browser = launchHeadlessBrowser();
  const page = browser.newPage();
  
  page.goto('https://app.prizepicks.com/');
  waitForReactComponentLoad();

  const props = page.evaluate(() => {
    return document.querySelectorAll('.prop-card').map(card => ({
      player: card.querySelector('.name').textContent,
      stat: card.querySelector('.stat-type').textContent,
      line: parseFloat(card.querySelector('.line').textContent),
      team: extractTeamFromContext(card),
      status: extractStatus(card),
    }));
  });

  return props;
}
4. 📈 Line Movement Tracking
Store every scrape in a timestamped DB (e.g., Firebase, SQLite).

Calculate movement:

ts
Copy
Edit
movement = currentLine - previousLine;
direction = movement > 0 ? '↑' : '↓';
5. 🔮 AI Alert Logic (Prototype)
ts
Copy
Edit
if (publicPercent > 75 && moneyPercent < 55 && lineMovesAgainstPublic) {
  sendAIAlert("🚨 Reverse Line Movement on [Player/Stat]");
}
6. 🧠 Smart Search Tagging
As props are scraped, store these attributes as searchable tags:

Player name

Team

Stat type (PTS, K, REB, etc.)

Book source

Line value

Sentiment strength (🔥, ❄️, 🚨)

Movement pattern

7. 📬 Schedule + Frequency
Scrape every 3–5 minutes during high traffic (game days).

Scrape every 15–30 min off-peak.

8. 🔐 Storage Plan (Short-Term)
Use Firebase Firestore or Replit DB

Collections:

props_today (live, overwrite)

prop_history (archival, trend use later)
