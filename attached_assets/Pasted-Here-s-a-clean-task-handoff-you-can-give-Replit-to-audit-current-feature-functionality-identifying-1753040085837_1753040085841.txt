Here's a clean task handoff you can give Replit to audit current feature functionality — identifying what's live, what's a placeholder, and what’s non-functional in your production build:

✅ Replit Developer Task: Feature Functionality Audit
Goal: Evaluate the current production build of the WAY (What Are You Actually Betting On?) platform and report which components and buttons are functional, which are mock/demo-only, and which are non-functional or visual placeholders.

🧪 1. Data Sources and Insight Rendering
✅ Confirm: Live data is used in production (Odds API, ESPN API).

🔍 Check:

Does each insight card (trap detection, sharp money, weather, fades) reflect real-time data?

Are there any hardcoded or mock responses still being used?

🔧 If any components are still showing mocked insight blocks, flag them.

📊 2. AI Analyst Output System
✅ Confirm: The AI response engine is hooked up to the smart prompting system.

🔍 Check:

Does each query type (e.g. “Is this a trap?”, “Any sharp money on Dodgers?”) route correctly to the right prompt logic?

Are we receiving mocked static responses, or does the prompt pipeline actually run and return varied results?

⚠️ Note: Identify if response formatting is static (mock JSON) or dynamic from LLM layer.

🎛️ 3. UI Button Audit
Sidebar
 Which sidebar nav buttons actually load real data or dynamic views?

 Which are stubs or non-interactive placeholders?

Dashboard Tiles
 Which tiles/charts/summary blocks reflect live computed insights?

 Are any of them showing static charts (e.g., sample trap stats or generic sharp fade examples)?

Forms/Input Fields
 Are the user input forms (game query box, AI question bar, etc.) actually submitting data to live logic?

 Any fields wired but returning no dynamic value or always giving a canned message?

⚠️ 4. Mock / Dev Artifacts Check
 Verify that no internal dev toggles, mock buttons, or test UI elements are showing in production.

 Confirm dev-only components (data switcher, mock logs) are hidden or stripped from build.

✅ Final Output
Provide a summary in this format:

Copy
Edit
Live & Functional:
- Game query bar
- Trap Detection module (fully hooked to live data)
- Weather overlay on game cards

Mocked / Needs Hook-up:
- Sharp money insights (static output)
- Player prop AI responses (template only)
- Fade recommendations module (pending LLM connection)

Non-functional / Placeholder:
- “Bet Smarter” sidebar button (visual only)
- Stats Overview tile (no dynamic connection)
Once this audit is returned, we’ll decide what to finish, what to hide, and how to tighten the core user experience around only the proven live features.

Would you like me to prep a one-click version of this task to send Replit via the sidebar chat, or do you want to copy and paste the full prompt manually?
