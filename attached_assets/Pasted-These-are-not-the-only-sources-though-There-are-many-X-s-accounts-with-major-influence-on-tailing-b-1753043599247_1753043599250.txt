These are not the only sources though. There are many X’s accounts with major influence on tailing bets. Or reddits as well. How can we allow our AI to incorporate those without overusing its capabilities 


ChatGPT said:
Great point — the real influence in betting often comes from X (formerly Twitter) accounts, Reddit threads, and community sentiment, not just raw data. You’re absolutely right to ask: How can we let the AI incorporate this "soft signal" info without overloading or misusing its capacity?

Let’s break it down into a smart, scalable roadmap for WAY to integrate influencer insights and community tailing trends, while keeping usage efficient, ethical, and technically sustainable.

✅ Objective
Allow WAY’s AI to augment traditional sports data with trusted influencer picks, Reddit trends, and tailing sentiment — without scraping blindly or exceeding resource limits.

🔍 Step 1: Identify Signal Sources
🧠 Influencer Accounts (X)
Accounts like:

@JomboyMedia

@Betsperts

@MLBLocks

@NFL_StatsGuru

@SharpClarkeNFL

These accounts:

Post pre-game betting logic

Call out injury news and market shifts

Start tail trends (others copy them)

You want the AI to understand what’s being tailed, and who is setting the tone.

🧵 Reddit Sources
r/sportsbook (for betting picks + groupthink)

r/nba, r/nfl, r/mlb (for injury/news sentiment)

r/dfsports (for player prop chatter)

These offer crowd momentum, ideal for tail-awareness or contrarian detection.

🧠 Step 2: What the AI Should Actually Do
We don’t want it reading 5,000 posts daily.

Instead:

Capability	Description
Summarize Influencer Picks	e.g. "Top 5 tailed picks today from X"
Detect Over-Tailed Picks	e.g. "George Kirby is the most tailed under today. AI recommends caution."
Highlight Market Movement w/ Social Context	e.g. "Line moved 0.5 due to viral tweet from @SharpClarkeNFL"
Reddit Pick Consensus	e.g. "r/sportsbook tailing Ohtani HR prop more than any other today."

This is summary-level insight, not full ingestion of social data.

⚙️ Step 3: How to Technically Do It (Free & Light)
🔁 Use Free Public APIs + Scheduled Crawls
Platform	Strategy
X (Twitter)	Use X’s public search endpoints or scrape 5-10 whitelisted accounts with Puppeteer/cron
Reddit	Use Reddit's official API to pull top daily threads and comments (filtered by flair or keywords)
Crowd Analysis	Simple keyword frequency + engagement scores (likes, RTs, upvotes)

You limit the volume like this:

Only fetch posts that mention specific bet types (e.g. "under 6.5", "ladder", "value pick")

Only summarize content posted in the last 12–18 hours

Don’t fetch more than 20 tweets + 10 Reddit threads/day

🔒 Step 4: Controls to Protect AI from Overuse
Control	Purpose
🔹 Caching system	Don’t hit Reddit/X APIs more than once/hour per source
🔹 Confidence tagging	Flag low-quality posts (spammy picks, bots)
🔹 Input truncation	Summarize and shorten inputs before AI sees them
🔹 Context prioritization	Only include tail picks that match WAY’s existing analysis for cross-validation

📍 Proposed Component in WAY
You could create a "Tail Watch" module inside your Trends or AI tab:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
🔥 TAIL WATCH - TODAY’S MOST FOLLOWED BETS

1. 🧠 George Kirby Under 5.5 Ks (70% tail rate) — driven by @SharpClarkeNFL + r/sportsbook
2. 💥 Shohei Ohtani HR prop — consensus play, posted by 3 influencers
3. ⚠️ Tommy Edman Steals prop — line movement suggests public fade
And the AI could comment:

“Based on social momentum and historical prop results, tailing Ohtani today aligns with value trends — but Kirby's Under is likely overtailed, introducing risk.”

✅ Summary of What You Can Build Now
Step	Action
1	Pick 5–10 X accounts to monitor (stable URLs)
2	Use Reddit API to pull top daily posts from r/sportsbook
3	Create a daily fetch + keyword/tag extractor
4	Let the AI see summarized community tail signals, not raw posts
5	Display in a clean "Tail Watch" tab with cross-check AI commentary

Would you like a full code scaffold for the Reddit + X tail detection system (free-tier optimized), or would you rather wireframe the Tail Watch UI and start from there?
