Excellent. You're building WAY – Who’s Actually Winning? — a public-facing, AI-powered prop betting trend analyzer that reflects AYAW’s values: truth, reflection, and reality over hype.

Let’s now map out Replit’s full role — what it will do, what it won't, and where the next phases will move as the project scales.

🚦 Full Project Roadmap: WAY (Who’s Actually Winning?)
🎯 Mission
Build an AI-guided betting trend interface that answers:

“Which props are the crowd hammering… and are they actually winning?”

🧠 Core Features (v1 through v3)
Phase	Description	AI Role	Input	Output
✅ Phase 1	Static + Simulated Data MVP	Hardcoded AI logic	Manual/Mock JSON	UI + Prewritten Insights
🔁 Phase 2	Live Scraping + AI Prompt Engine	GPT-4 + NLP	Real social/forum/sportsbook data	Dynamic AI Cards, Trend Feed
📊 Phase 3	Insight Engine + Pattern Analysis	ML or GPT	Historical + real-time props	Trap Warnings, Fade Recs, Alt Picks

🧱 What Replit Will Handle (Fully Capable)
Component	Description	Status
🎨 UI/UX Build	React + Tailwind frontend with prop cards, heatmaps, AI prompt bar	✅ Yes
🧪 Mock Data Testing	JSON files for props, over/under %, sentiment tags	✅ Yes
🔄 Live Reload Dev	Real-time edits, visual testing, collaboration	✅ Yes
🤖 AI Prompt Simulation	Use OpenAI API or hardcoded mock GPT logic	✅ Yes
🔧 Lightweight API Backend	Node.js or Python FastAPI for serving props	✅ Yes
🔐 Developer Collaboration	Instant sharing, edits, comments	✅ Yes
📦 Public Beta Hosting	Replit live hosting (limited traffic OK)	✅ Yes

🔴 Where Replit Will Hit Limits
Component	Limitation	Why
⏱️ Cron Jobs / Scheduled Tasks	❌ Not reliable	Replit isn’t built for long-running or scheduled tasks like daily scraping
🕷️ Web Scraping at Scale	⚠️ Risky	Scrapers may get IP-blocked or crash if run from Replit long-term
🔍 Data Persistence	⚠️ Limited DB scaling	Replit databases aren’t built for large-scale analytics or historical storage
🧠 Fine-Tuned AI Models	❌ Not supported	You can use OpenAI APIs, but not train or deploy your own models on Replit
🔐 Secure API Keys	⚠️ Only semi-secure	Need to use environment variables carefully; exposed if frontend calls backend directly
🌍 Multi-user Sessions	⚠️ Not designed for auth + real user control	AYAW’s Pro Mode-style personal logging not suited here — use Supabase/Firebase later

🪜 After Replit: When and Where to Migrate
Task	Replit Phase	Migration Target
🔁 Scraping Reddit/X/Action	Phase 2	Render.com, Cloud Functions, or Supabase Edge
📚 Historical Tracking	Phase 2+	Supabase or Firebase for scalable DB
⚙️ Scheduled Jobs (daily sync)	Phase 2+	CRON + GitHub Actions or Serverless triggers
👥 User Profiles (if added later)	Phase 3	Firebase Auth or Clerk.dev
🚀 Production Hosting	Phase 2–3	Vercel (frontend) + Supabase or Railway backend

💬 Natural Language Prompt Engine (v1 Simulation)
You’ll include a PromptBox.tsx where users can ask:

“What’s the riskiest over today?”

“Which top prop lost yesterday?”

“Who is everyone fading?”

For v1, this will return mock GPT answers based on the trends.json file. For v2, we plug in OpenAI API + prompt templates like:

ts

const prompt = `Given today's prop trend data:
${JSON.stringify(trends)}

What are 3 traps the public is walking into today?`;
✅ Summary: Replit's Role in WAY
🟢 DO:
Prototype full-stack (React + Node/Python)

Simulate AI-guided prop trends

Run live demos, UI tests, OpenAI API prompts

Build lean v1 with mocked trend data and insights

🔴 STOP AT:
Scheduled scraping

Heavy backend processing

Large historical datasets

Multi-user auth

Secure production handling of sportsbook data
