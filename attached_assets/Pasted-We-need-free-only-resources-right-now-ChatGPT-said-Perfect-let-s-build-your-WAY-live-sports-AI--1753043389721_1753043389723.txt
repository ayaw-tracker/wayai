✅ Phase-by-Phase Data Integration Roadmap (Free-Only)
📍 Phase 1: Core Sports Data (Today)
 NFL (ESPN + The Odds API)

 NBA (NBA Stats API + ESPN)

 MLB (Statcast + ESPN)

 NHL (NHL Stats API)

 Trends: Add basic TeamRankings.com scrape

📍 Phase 2: AI-Readable Structuring
 Normalize all sport data to a common object

 Tag each game/player with metadata: team, injury, odds

 Add basic AI engine (e.g., "Highlight high xBA hitters today")

📍 Phase 3: Live Tabs Per Sport
 Sport switcher tab or dropdown

 Load appropriate AI summary cards per sport

 Toast warning if live odds are unavailable (fallback to ESPN/stats)

Would you like me to start drafting the sport switcher UI component and the API call logic for NBA + MLB using only these free sources?
