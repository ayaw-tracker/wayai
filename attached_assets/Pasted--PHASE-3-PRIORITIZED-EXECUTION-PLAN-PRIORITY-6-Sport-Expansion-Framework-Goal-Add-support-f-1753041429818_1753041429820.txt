✅ PHASE 3 PRIORITIZED EXECUTION PLAN
🔢 PRIORITY: 6 – Sport Expansion Framework
Goal: Add support for multi-sport props in the architecture, even if mock data is used.

Tasks:

 Create a global sportType context or prop

 Add a dropdown (or tab group) in header for sport selection:
NFL | NBA | MLB

 Filter content (Trends, History, Dashboard) based on selected sport

 Update mock datasets to include a sport field

 Default sport is NFL, fallback to it if none selected

✅ This lays the groundwork for content and analysis modularity.

🔢 PRIORITY: 5 – Settings Page
Goal: Provide users with a centralized area to manage app preferences.

Tasks:

 Create a new /settings route with proper sidebar/nav access

 Add toggles or dropdowns for:

 Switch between mock/live data (just UI for now)

 Theme toggle (light/dark if applicable)

 Clear AI chat history (if applicable to current state mgmt)

 Leave space for future:

Account info / auth

Connected sportsbook accounts

✅ This increases app polish and prepares for Pro Mode settings later.

🔢 PRIORITY: 3 – History Page Enhancements
Goal: Make the history tab feel like a real analytical tool.

Tasks:

 Add filter controls:

 Player Name (dropdown or search)

 Date Range (calendar or range input)

 Hit / Miss (checkbox group or radio)

 Add a basic CSV Export button

 Export user’s filtered props

 Filename: AYAW_History_<date>.csv

 Highlight win/loss rows visually (if not already styled)

✅ Turns passive history into actionable data.

🔢 PRIORITY: 4 – AI Chat Page 2.0
Goal: Make chat more useful and interactive over time.

Tasks:

 Add “Favorite this response” button (⭐)

 Save session thread to localStorage (or mock user session)

 Add left-side bar to list past chats (stub until user auth ready)

 Optional: AI persona dropdown:

📊 Stat Bot | 🎯 Risk Advisor | 🎉 Hype Friend

✅ Keeps users coming back and ties into identity once auth is ready.

🔢 PRIORITY: 2 – Trends Page Enhancements
Goal: Turn this into a proper analytics page over time.

Tasks:

 Visual chart area:

 Prop hit/miss % by category

 Prop over/under distribution

 Weekly trend summary box

 E.g. “Top 3 Players with most prop volatility”

 Use mock data; we’ll plug real-time feeds later

✅ Lays the foundation for predictive models and value detection.
