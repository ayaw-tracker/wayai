That’s a powerful milestone — WAY is shaping up to be a standout in the prop trend analytics space. Now that your core UI, mock AI engine, and backend are functional, here’s a prioritized list of what the agent (or you) should tackle next:

🔁 Priority Next Steps (Post-MVP)
1. 🔍 Real Data Integration – Source Parsers
Replace mock data with live or semi-live props from real platforms.

Goal: Daily ingestion of trending props from public sources.

Options:

Reddit Scraper: Parse r/sportsbook + r/dfsports for prop mentions (e.g., using keywords like "Over", "Under", "O/U")

Twitter/X: Search hashtags or keywords like #PrizePicks or Over 6.5 K

Action Network (Public Leaderboards): Scrape or simulate top tracked bets

🔧 Store data in trendHistory.json or pipe it into a lightweight in-memory DB.

2. 🧠 Real AI Prompt Integration (OpenAI or DeepSeek)
Make the AI prompt bar actually respond to user input dynamically.

Tasks:

Connect the PromptBox.tsx to OpenAI API (or DeepSeek’s)

Feed it daily trend data as context (props, public %, history)

Implement prompt templates like:

ts
Copy
Edit
"What are the top 3 public-heavy props with poor hit rates in the last 7 days?"
3. 📊 Historical Accuracy Tracker
Add a system that tracks:

Did the top 5 props from yesterday hit or miss?

What is the hit rate of heavily tailed props (public >70%) this week?

How:

Add a “Result” field to each tracked prop (W/L)

Auto-classify next day based on box score (future step)

Update trend cards with a history badge:
✅ "Trending props are hitting at 61% this week"
❌ "Last time Jokic Over 26.5 was this popular, it missed"

4. 🚨 AI-Flagged Traps and Fade Radar
Create an internal AI or rules engine that identifies:

Props with 80%+ public backing + line movement

Picks that are overly consistent across all platforms (herd behavior)

Props with historical fade value

Example Tags:

🚨 Crowd Trap

🧠 Sharp Pivot

🔄 Reverse Line Movement

📉 Losing Trend (0-3 streak)

This gives WAY character — not just data, but opinion and alerts.

5. 🌍 Export or Embed Mode
Eventually allow:

Prop trend insights to be embedded (read-only) on another site (like AYAW)

Export trend snapshots as JSON/CSV (for future ML work)

You don’t need this now, but architecting for it helps.

🪜 Bonus Stretch Features (Phase 2+)
Feature	Value
Voice prompt mode	Ask WAY a question verbally (fun for mobile)
Prop comparison tool	“Who’s actually winning: Over or Under bettors?”
Public vs Sharp % Split	Once you get real data from betting APIs or models
Prop pattern recognizer	"This type of Jokic prop (O/U 25–27 pts) loses 65% when public >80%"

🧠 Suggested Next Agent Task
“Begin building the Reddit + Twitter/X prop trend scraper module. Use NLP to identify Over/Under patterns, and feed the output into the backend trend feed for live use.”
