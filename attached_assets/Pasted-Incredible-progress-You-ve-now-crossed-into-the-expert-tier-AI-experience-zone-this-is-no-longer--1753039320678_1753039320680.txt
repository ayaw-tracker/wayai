Incredible progress! You’ve now crossed into the expert-tier AI experience zone — this is no longer a demo, it’s becoming a real strategic betting companion.

Given what you've accomplished, here are smart next steps, grouped by priority tier depending on what matters most to you next:

🔥 High-Impact Next Steps (Phase 3 Core Goals)
These will elevate the AI betting experience from powerful to indispensable.

1. Real-Time Betting Data Integration
Replace mock data with live feeds from:

Odds APIs (e.g., OddsAPI, TheOddsAPI, BetRadar, or BetQL if affordable)

Betting exchange data (for sharper volume movement)

Weather/Player injury APIs for deeper context-aware predictions

💡 Result: AI insights will be based on true market trends and current risk patterns, not simulation.

2. User Personalization Engine
Let the AI know who the user is:

Add simple login (email, Google auth, or token-based)

Save user preferences (sports, risk level, favorite props)

Tailor AI suggestions to user trends or past behavior

💡 Example: “You usually fade high-volume overs — today’s top risk match is…”

3. Save & Share Bets / Insights
Let users:

Save their AI-assisted picks

Share summaries to social (optionally)

Compare their pick vs the AI’s suggestion

💡 This moves the app from “tool” → social-edge platform without compromising privacy-first stance.

🧠 Advanced Intelligence Features (Optional Layer)
To go beyond even expert tier:

AI Self-Awareness Layer: Make the analyst “track itself” — was its previous pick right? Can it adjust risk scores?

Session Memory for AI: Persist recent betting topics in the UI so AI can refer to them without re-querying.

Multi-model Prompt Fusion: Let user pick between different AI styles — conservative, aggressive, narrative-heavy, or stats-first.

🧰 Dev & Infrastructure (to prepare for real use)
Add OpenAI Usage Monitoring – track API costs, daily call volume, fallbacks.

Environment switcher (mock vs live) – useful for dev, demo, and emergency mode.

Progressive Deployment Plan – to Replit staging, then Firebase or Vercel/Render for prod.

Rate-limiting & abuse protection if opening to wider users.

📱 Bonus: Mobile Experience
Now that you’ve nailed the smart stuff:

Rework the UI into a mobile-first experience (most bettors are on phones)

Add haptic feedback / swipe for prop cards

Floating AI button always accessible for live queries

✅ Suggested Immediate Next Sprint:
If you're looking to split this into chunks, here’s a suggested plan for Next Sprint (3–5 days):

Priority	Feature	Notes
🚨 Core	Replace mock data w/ 1–2 real odds feeds	Just props for 1 sport to start (e.g., NBA or MLB)
🧠 Smart	Add user ID memory to AI prompt	Store basic prefs and recent queries
⚡ UX Polish	Add simple loading states + API quota UI	Improve trust and feedback loop
📦 Infra	Add .env and rate limit system	Prepare for live public usage

Let me know which of these directions feels right to you — I can then break that into exact implementation tasks or Replit handover instructions.
