# WAY - Who's Actually Winning?

## Overview

WAY is an AI-powered prop betting research and insights engine that helps users identify betting edges and patterns. As a publicly accessible demo tool, it analyzes prop betting trends across multiple sports to reveal where public money flows and whether those bets actually win, providing AI-generated insights about public traps, sharp money moves, and fade opportunities.

**Status**: Firebase-Enabled Comprehensive Scraper System ACTIVE - Live Firebase integration with Google API key configured for real-time prop line monitoring across PrizePicks, Underdog, and DraftKings. Social sentiment tracking from Reddit communities operational. Firebase collections (live_props, prop_history, line_movements, sentiment_data, ai_alerts) storing authentic betting data. Scraper Control Panel integrated into dashboard for real-time management and monitoring.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project Mission: Building WAY as a live sports market analyst tool powered by authentic data. Core objective: clean live data ingestion from ESPN and sports APIs, efficient parsing, and correct sport routing (NFL/NBA/MLB) with zero synthetic data bleed-through. AI Chat and frontend features are secondary to establishing this reliable data foundation.
